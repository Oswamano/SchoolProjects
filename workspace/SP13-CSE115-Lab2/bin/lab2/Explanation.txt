following line.
------------------------------------------------------------
It worked this way because... i)In part one, the reason half the creatures did not move is because they were started then stopped instantly.
There was no time gap between the start and stop calls, so as soon as the creature started moving it stopped.
ii).In the second part, once the stop calls were removed, there was no reason for the creatures to stop, so all of the creatures kept moving.
