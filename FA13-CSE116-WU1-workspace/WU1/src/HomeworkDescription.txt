CSE116 Fall 2013 - WRITE-UP #1

Define a method named 'solution', in a class named 'WriteUp', in a package named 'code',
as follows:

	/**
	 * @param s, a String
	 * @param c1, a character
	 * @param c2, a character
	 * @return the character (c1 or c2) that occurs more in the String s; if
	 *         c1 and c2 occurs equally often in s, return c1. 
	 *  
	 * Keep in mind that the String s can be *any* valid Java String.
	 * 
	 * Here are some examples:
	 * 
	 * solution("",'a','b') must return 'a'
	 * solution("an aardvark is able",'a','b') must return 'a'
	 * solution("b..b..blistering blue barnacles",'a','b') must return 'b'
	 * solution("AAAb",'a','b') must return 'b' (since 'A' != 'a')
	 * 
	 * The only methods you may call on the String s are charAt(int) and length().
	 */
