CSE116 Write-up #4


GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS:
--------------------
Your task is to define a class with one method, described below.

Your class must be defined in a named package placed in the 'src' folder.
You may NOT name the package 'tests' or 'util', but aside from that any
valid Java package name is acceptable.

You may choose any valid Java class name for your class.

You may choose any valid Java method names for your methods.  Your methods may
be either static or non-static, but if non-static your class must provide a 
no-argument constructor (either the default constructor, or an explicit one).

/**************************************************************************
 * @param a String denoting a path on the local filesystem, the input file
 * @returns a HashMap<String,Integer> containing author-to-count mappings
 *
 * This method must read the contents of a file (identified by inputFilePath),
 * one char at a time, find the authors in the file, and keep track of author
 * counts in a java.util.HashMap<String,Integer>. 
 * 
 * An author is defined as a contiguous sequence of characters that appear
 * between an opening {A} tag and its corresponding closing {a} tag.
 *
 * You MUST use the state-transition approach (explained in recitation)
 * for solving this problem, since learning this technique was part of
 * the goal of this homework.
 *
 * You MUST also draw a suitable state-transition diagram for your solution,
 * and hand it in at the conclusion of your write-up.
 *   
 * You must use only CharacterFromFileReader to read characters from the input
 * file.
 *
